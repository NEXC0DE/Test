It is the primary API you will leverage to create and manage your deployments of IBM DataPower Gateway.\n\nBelow is a brief example of what a minimal `DataPowerService` may look like:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: datapower.ibm.com/v1beta3\nkind: DataPowerService\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  license:\n    accept: true\n    use: developers-limited\n    license: L-RJON-BYDQZF\n  version: 10.0-cd\n  replicas: 3\n  users:\n  - name: admin\n    passwordSecret: admin-credentials\n    accessLevel: privileged\n```\n\nThe above Custom Resource would be translated to a StatefulSet with 3 replicas of `developers-limited` licensed IBM DataPower Pods (pulled from [ibmcom/datapower](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/datapower/)), each running the latest `10.0` Continuous Delivery release.\n\nFor more details, see the complete `DataPowerService` API [documentation](/apis/datapowerservice/spec).\n\n### Managed StatefulSet\n\nThe IBM DataPower Operator exposes the `DataPowerService` Custom Resource Definition as a mechanism to deploy and manage StatefulSets of IBM DataPower Pods. When you create a `DataPowerService` Custom Resource, the Operator will reconcile this resource by creating and managing the StatefulSet. For each `DataPowerService` Custom Resource created, another StatefulSet will be created. They are tightly coupled: when you make an update to an `DataPowerService` instance, its StatefulSet will be automatically updated accordingly.\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** You should not manually edit the StatefulSet that is created by the Operator. Any changes you make to the StatefulSet will be overwritten by the Operator during reconcilation.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n### Creating a DataPowerService instance\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You must install the DataPower Operator prior to creating any `DataPowerService` Custom Resource instances.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nOnce you've built your `DataPowerService` YAML, you can use `oc` or `kubectl` CLI tools to apply that YAML to the cluster, in a target namespace, to create the `DataPowerService` instance.\n\n```\noc apply -f my_datapowerservice_cr.yaml\n```\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you attempt to create a `DataPowerService` immediately after installing the operator, you may see a timeout error from the webhooks. Simply wait ~10 seconds and try the apply/create again.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Deleting a DataPowerService instance\n\nYou can delete an existing `DataPowerService` using standard `oc delete` or `kubectl delete` commands. When you delete the `DataPowerService`, the DataPower StatefulSet will also be deleted, thus deleting your DataPower deployment entirely.\n\n```\noc delete DataPowerService/name\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1cb9bf1e5f4c139f372648934ddc4227","counter":120,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started","description":"Quick start guide for getting acclimated with IBM DataPower Operator"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Getting started\ndescription: Quick start guide for getting acclimated with IBM DataPower Operator\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIBM DataPower Operator is capable of packaging, deploying, and managing your IBM DataPower Gateway so that you can focus on developing and deploying your configuration and code, and less on operations.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Installation Methods\n\nThere are two methods to install the IBM DataPower Operator:\n\n1.
