In the logs you might see\n```\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-09-08T19:29:53.432Z\",\"logger\":\"leader\",\"msg\":\"Not the leader. Waiting.\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-09-08T19:29:57.971Z\",\"logger\":\"leader\",\"msg\":\"Leader pod has been deleted, waiting for garbage collection do remove the lock.\"}\n```\nfollowed by additional waiting. In this case, Kubernetes' garbage collection failed to clean up the `datapower-operator-lock` after the old Leader Pod was removed. This stops the new DataPower Operator Pod from completing initialization tasks such as creating the conversion webhook.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo resolve this issue, you must manually remove the lock resource. This can be done with\n```\nkubectl delete cm datapower-operator-lock\n```\nOnce the lock is removed, the new DataPower Operator pod will begin its initialization.\n\n# 1.0.1\n\n## Invalid value for `spec.selector`\n\nWhen attempting to ugprade from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` through the Operator Lifecycle Manager, an error will likely be seen that the `installPlan` failed.\n\n```\ninstall strategy failed: Deployment.apps \"datapower-operator\" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: v1.LabelSelector{...}, MatchExpressions:[]v1.LabelSelectorRequirement(nil)}: field is immutable\n```\n\nThis error occurs because between version `1.0.0` and `1.0.1` a new `label` was added to the DataPower Operator Deployment resource to fix an issue related to operator-metrics. However, the install plan is not able to resolve this update because the LabelSelector is an immutable field.\n\n### Resolution\n\nTo workaround this issue, you can manually delete the existing `datapower-operator` Deployment resource. The Operator Lifecycle Manager should then recreate the `datapower-operator` Deployment resource with the `1.0.1` spec, and the install plan should succeed.\n\n```\noc delete deployment datapower-operator\n```\n\nOnce done, validate a new `datapower-operator` Deployment is created:\n\n```\noc get deployment\n```\n\nThen validate the `1.0.1` install plan succeeds by checking the `ClusterServiceVersion` resource:\n\n```\n$ oc get csv\nNAME                        DISPLAY                 VERSION   REPLACES                    PHASE\ndatapower-operator.v1.0.1   IBM DataPower Gateway   1.0.1     datapower-operator.v1.0.0   Succeeded\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4b37e36d697a3aae0b4c15a06f60b31f","counter":120,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DataPower Operator Upgrades","description":"Troubleshooting guide related to upgrading the DataPower Operator"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: DataPower Operator Upgrades\ndescription: Troubleshooting guide related to upgrading the DataPower Operator\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIf any known issues exist or migration paths are needed to upgrade from one version of the DataPower Operator to another, they will be documented here.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n# 1.1.0\n\n## Operator lock not released after Leader Pod removed\n\n### Symptoms\n\n- Immediately following an upgrade from 1.0.X to 1.1.X, you may see the following error when attempting to interact with a DataPowerService CR:\n  ```\n  Error from server: conversion webhook for datapower.ibm.com/v1beta1, Kind=DataPowerService failed: Post https://changeme.default.svc:443/?timeout=30s: service \"changeme\" not found\n  ```\n- Failure to reconcile changes made to a DataPowerService CR after a failover event caused the previous DataPower Operator Leader Pod to be rescheduled.\n\n### Description\n\nOccasionally, when the DataPower Operator Leader Pod is removed, the new DataPower Operator Pod will show as being Ready but isn't doing anything.
