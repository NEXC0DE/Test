Our APIs are described by our CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), which have an `apiVersion` associated with them. Each version of a given CRD can have its own schema, and thus the functionality of a given CRD version can change over time.\n\nFor more information on the conversion webhook that makes these migrations possible, see our [Conversion webhook](/features/webhooks#conversion-webhook) documentation.\n\n## v1beta2 migration\n\nThe release of `1.1.0` introduces a `v1beta2` API and a new `DataPowerMonitor` CustomResourceDefinition. When upgrading from `1.0.x` to `1.1.x` the following migrations will occur:\n\n- Any existing `v1beta1` `DataPowerService` Custom Resources (CRs) will be converted to `v1beta2` CRs.\n- The `dataPowerMonitor` spec from the `v1beta1` CR will be translated to an equivalent `v1beta2` `DataPowerMonitor` CR.\n- If a `v1beta1` `DataPowerService` specified a **channel** in `spec.version` it will be converted according to the following rules:\n  - `spec.version: 10.0.0` becomes `spec.version: 10.0-cd`\n  - `spec.version: 10.0.1` becomes `spec.version: 10.0-lts`\n\n## v1beta3 migration\n\nThe release of `1.3.0` introduces a `v1beta3` API for the `DataPowerService` CustomResourceDefinition. When upgrading from `1.2.x` to `1.3.x` the following migrations will occur:\n\n- Any existing `v1beta2` `DataPowerService` instances will be converted to `v1beta3`.\n- `spec.license.license` is a new **required** field in `v1beta3` of the `DataPowerService`, and as such will be automatically populated during migration.\n- If upgrading from `1.2.x` and `spec.version` is set to `10.0-eus`, this will be migrated to `10.0-lts`. Note that this will incur no change to the DataPower operand runtime.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0c6e9f4fe0d29908625dacfa5a30b980","counter":113,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"API Migration","description":"Migration of CustomResourceDefinition API versions"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: API Migration\ndescription: Migration of CustomResourceDefinition API versions\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nAs new CustomResourceDefinition API versions are released, the API migrations which occur on those boundaries will be documented here.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Background</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>v1beta2 migration</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>v1beta3 migration</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Background\n\nAs we iterate on the DataPower Operator, add new functionality, etc. our APIs will invetibly change over time.
