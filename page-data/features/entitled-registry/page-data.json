You can obtain an Entitlement Key from [My IBM](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).\n\n### Creating the Secret\n\nFor the DataPower Operator to automatically consume your Entitlement Key, you must create a `Secret` in the same namespace as the `DataPowerService` Custom Resource.\n\n1. Use `ibm-entitlement-key` as the name of the Secret\n2. Use `cp` as the username\n3. Use your Entitlement Key as the password\n4. Use `cp.icr.io` as the Docker server\n\nFor example:\n\n```\noc create secret docker-registry \\\n  ibm-entitlement-key \\\n  --docker-username=cp \\\n  --docker-password=<entitlement-key> \\\n  --docker-server=cp.icr.io\n```\n\nFor more information on creating Secrets using the Kubernetes command line, please see their [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line).\n\n### Using a custom Service Account\n\nIf you choose to provide your own custom Service Account via the [serviceAccountName](/apis/datapowerservice/spec#serviceaccountname) property on the `DataPowerService` spec, then the DataPower Operator **will not** automatically attempt to use a `ibm-entitlement-key` Secret.
