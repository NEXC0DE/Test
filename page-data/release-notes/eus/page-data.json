Set `topologyKey` to well-known \"zone\" label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`.\n  - Set `whenUnsatisfiable` to `ScheduleAnyway` to avoid blocked scheduling.\n\n## 1.2.0\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Add support for `datapower-cp4i` image, see [Image selection](/features/entitled-registry#image-selection) and [Cloud Pak for Integration: Gateway runtime](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS9H2Y_10.0/com.ibm.dp.doc/icp4i.html).\n- Add support for DataPower version `10.0.1.1`.\n- Add support for Cloud Pak for Integration 2020.4.1 EUS release.\n- Pod scheduling errors are now raised as `Conditions` on the `DataPowerService` instance.\n\n### Changes\n\n- `DataPowerService` CR names are now limited to 52 characters.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- `storage.volumeMode` is deprecated, and will now always be set to `Filesystem` for `persistent` storage requests.\n  - If set to `Block` previously, the CR will be migrated to use `Filesystem` instead, automatically.\n\n### Platform\n\n- Minimum OCP version is now 4.6.\n- Minimum Kubernetes version is now 1.17.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"10dabd622bf950209a6a7bf0d46968b3","counter":136,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Release Notes","tabs":["CD","EUS"],"description":"IBM DataPower Operator release notes"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Release Notes\ntabs: ['CD', 'EUS']\ndescription: IBM DataPower Operator release notes\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nRelease notes for EUS releases.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## 1.2.9\n\n- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.7`, available in the `10.0-eus` and `10.0-lts` [channels](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#channels).\n- Fix an issue preventing DataPower pods from scheduling on Kubernetes when running under the `restricted` PodSecurityPolicy.\n- Fix an issue in the conversion webhook management which caused errors when more than one namespace-scope operator was installed on a cluster.\n\n## 1.2.8\n\n- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.6sr1`, available in the `10.0-eus` and `10.0-lts` [channels](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#channels).\n- Fix an issue relating to conversion webhook discovery causing unnecessary queries to the Kubernetes API server.\n- Fix an issue which caused status updates of the `DataPowerService` custom resource to overwrite existing status erroneously.\n- Fix an issue relating to how the operator registers its custom resources for serving metrics.\n\n## 1.2.7\n\n- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.6`, available in the `10.0-eus` and `10.0-lts` [channels](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#channels).\n\n## 1.2.6\n\n- Fix an issue relating to `odTracing` agent container args.\n\n## 1.2.5\n\n- Add support for DataPower firmware version `10.0.1.5`, available in the `10.0-eus` and `10.0-lts` [channels](/apis/datapowerservice/v1beta2#channels).\n- Fix an issue which caused the StatefulSet to perform a rolling update immediately after becoming `Ready`.\n- The `developers-limited` DataPower image is now hosted on IBM Container Registry at `icr.io/integration/datapower/datapower-limited`.\n- New `ibm-datapower-operator` CASE, see [Installation via CASE](/install/case) for details.\n  -
